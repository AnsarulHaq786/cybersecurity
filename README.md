# 🔐 My Cybersecurity Journey 🚀

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I’m documenting my **#111DaysOfLearningForChange** journey. This challenge, organized by **Code For Change Kathmandu**, is all about diving into cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and everything in between. Over the next 111 days, I’ll be learning, experimenting, and sharing my progress — one step at a time.



## 🧠 What I’m Getting Into

This is all about building a strong foundation in cybersecurity while staying consistent. Here’s what I’ll be focusing on:

- Learning the basics of cybersecurity and tools
- Hands-on labs (recon, scanning, web attacks, etc.)
- Practicing CTFs (Capture the Flag challenges)
- Brushing up on Linux and networking essentials
- Keeping track of everything with Markdown notes and logs
- Building discipline and sticking to the process

## 📌 How I’ll Track Progress

I’ll keep this repo updated with:

- 🗒️ Notes (`notes/`)
- 🧪 Lab exercises and tool experiments (`labs/`)
- 🎯 CTF write-ups (`ctf-writeups/`)
- 🔗 Handy tools, resources, and bookmarks (`resources/`)
- 📖 Reflections and lessons learned

No rush, no pressure — just showing up every day and doing the work.
