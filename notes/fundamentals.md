# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Overview

Cybersecurity is all about **protecting systems, networks, and data** from digital threats. In today's world, where everything is connected to the internet, securing digital infrastructure is more important than ever.

Whether it's personal data, financial records, or communication systems ‚Äî protecting them from unauthorized access, misuse, or damage is at the core of cybersecurity.


## üîë Core Principles ‚Äì The CIA Triad

To secure any infrastructure effectively, we follow three key principles ‚Äî known as the **CIA Triad**:

1. **Confidentiality**
   - Only authorized individuals or systems can access sensitive information.
   - Techniques: Encryption, Access Control, Two-Factor Authentication.

2. **Integrity**
   - Ensures that information is not altered or tampered with by unauthorized parties.
   - Techniques: Hashing, Digital Signatures, Checksums.

3. **Availability**
   - Information and systems must be accessible to authorized users when needed.
   - Techniques: Redundancy, Load Balancing, DDoS Protection.

## üí• Common Types of Cyber Attacks

Cyber threats come in many forms. Here are **five common types** of attacks:

1. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**
   - Attackers overload a system with traffic, making it unavailable to users.
   - Example: Botnets flooding a website to take it offline.

2. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack**
   - An attacker intercepts communication between two parties to steal or manipulate data.
   - Example: Eavesdropping on unsecured Wi-Fi.

3. **Phising**
   - Tricking users into revealing sensitive info or installing malware via fake emails.
   - Example: ‚ÄúYour account is at risk ‚Äì click this link!‚Äù

4. **Password Attacks**
   - Attempting to steal or guess passwords using various methods.
   - Types: Brute force, Dictionary attacks, Credential stuffing.

5. **Malware Attacks**
   - Malicious software designed to harm, exploit, or steal data.
   - Examples: Viruses, Worms, Ransomware, Trojans.

6. **Drive-By Download Attacks**

   -  Malware is downloaded and installed without the user‚Äôs consent when visiting a compromised or malicious website.
    - Example: Clicking on a pop-up or banner ad on an infected site.

7. **Malvertising**

   - The use of online ads to spread malware.
   - Example: A seemingly legitimate ad that, when clicked, installs harmful software.

8. **Rogue Software Attacks**

   - Fake security or utility software that tricks users into installing it, often to steal information or install additional malware.
   - Example: "Your PC is infected! Download this antivirus now!"
